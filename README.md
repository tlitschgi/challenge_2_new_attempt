# 02 Advanced CSS: Portfolio - 2nd Attempt

The purpose of this website is to build a portfolio page about myself.

Building this portfolio allows me to apply the lessons learned during the coding bootcamp classes.

At the top left of the page is a picture of me.  The header background is light steel blue background with my name in dark blue to the right of the picture. On the right, are three clickable links..."About Me," "Work," and "Contact Me" "Resume" in light blue.

Beneath the header are three sections, 1) About Me, 2) Work and 3) Contact Me. They are titled on the left side of the page in dark blue with a font size of 24. After each title, there is a dark blue vertical bar to separate the title from the content that relates to the title.

The first section is "About Me." The content contains brief details about me.

The second section is "Work." The section contains five rectangular pictures in three rows.  The top row is one image across the entire row with a clickable link to the Horiseon Website, my first project completed.  The middle and bottom rows have two images evenly split evenly across the content. The first picture in the middle row contains a clickable link to the Employee Payroll Tracker, another project completed.  The last three pictures are placeholders for future use. 

The third section is "Contact Me." The section includes three executable links in dark blue. They are my cell phone number, email address, verbiage "LinkedIn" in which will take you to my LinkedIn page.

The page does have media query functionality. As the page shrinks, the title background will change colors and the links will get smaller in size.

As the coding bootcamp progresses, I will be updating this website with more details about me and my work. Also, the code will be udpated for easier readability and maintenance as well as modified with new functionality added.
